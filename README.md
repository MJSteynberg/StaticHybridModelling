# Static Hybrid Modelling

This repository hosts a series of experiments on hybrid modelling of a Helmholtz equation using a physics-based model, a synthetic (neural network) model, and a PINN (Physics-Informed Neural Network) variant. The main experiments are implemented in [`src/experiment_baseline.py`, `src/experiment_1.py`, `src/experiment_2.py`](src/experiment_baseline.py, src/experiment_1.py, src/experiment_2.py), which contains three training strategies:

- **Hybrid Training:** Jointly trains the physics and synthetic models.
- **Physics-only Training:** Updates only the physics model parameters.
- **PINN Training:** Combines a PDE residual loss with a supervised data loss and freezes physics updates if the PDE loss exceeds a user-defined threshold.

## Experiment Details

### True Model Initialization

- **Objective:** Generate a high-resolution "true solution" using a Helmholtz model with Gaussian coefficient functions.
- **Details:**
  - True model parameters are defined as a six-element JAX array.
  - The training subdomain is sampled from a grid over a defined region.
  - This solution is used as a reference for the training experiments.

### Hybrid Training

- **Objective:** Simultaneously train the physics and synthetic models.
- **Methodology:**
  - Compute a combined loss that scales the physics loss and includes a hybrid component.
  - Uses alternating updates where synthetic model updates occur multiple times per physics update.
- **Output:** Saves hybrid loss and parameter state histories in the appropriate src/files/experiment folder.

### Physics-only Training

- **Objective:** Update only the physics model.
- **Methodology:**
  - The loss is computed solely from the physics component; the synthetic loss is ignored.
- **Output:** Saves physics loss and parameter state histories in the appropriate src/files/experiment folder.

### PINN Training

- **Objective:** Enhance training with a supervised data loss while enforcing the physics-induced PDE residual.
- **Methodology:**
  - Collocation points are generated over the domain.
  - The loss function comprises:
    - PDE loss (mean squared error of the PDE residual).
    - Supervised data loss (difference between the synthetic model prediction and the true solution).
  - If the computed PDE loss exceeds a threshold (set to 1e-1), the physics parameters are not updated.
- **Output:** Saves PINN loss and parameter state histories in the appropriate src/files/experiment folder.
